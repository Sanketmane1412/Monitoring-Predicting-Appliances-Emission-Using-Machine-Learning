# Monitoring-Predicting-Appliances-Emission-Using-Machine-Learning

This project was developed with support from Smartstack Global Venture Company to study and predict carbon emissions from household appliances. We used a real-world CSV dataset related to refrigerator usage, which included details such as energy consumption, temperature, and environmental factors.

The first phase focused on cleaning and preparing the data. We addressed missing values, fixed inconsistencies, and removed irrelevant columns to make the data ready for analysis. After this, we conducted exploratory analysis to identify patterns and relationships affecting CO₂ emissions. Using this cleaned data, we trained a machine learning regression model to predict carbon emissions accurately.

To make the project practical and easy to use, we integrated the trained ML model into a web application. The website lets users input information about their appliances and receive immediate feedback on current carbon emissions along with predictions for future emissions. We also included extra insights like risk identification and suggestions for optimizing energy use.

Through this project, I gained practical experience in data preparation, ML model training, real-time prediction, and full deployment. I learned how data science solutions can help support environmental sustainability and better decision-making.
